What this YouTube video and comment below what you learned: https://youtu.be/R54neaLznFA

he had his node js server running before npm starting the react app.
things ive noticed were he created a seperate javascript file for the navbar
some the of on click events that we used are being used here as well
so he used bootstrap to import a lot of the design but used react strap for the nav bar
